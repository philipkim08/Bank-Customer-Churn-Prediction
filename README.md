# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This mini-project explores the implementation of Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest with a banking churn dataset from Kaggle. Cross validation was utilized to tune the models and achieve the highest accuracy possible. Random Forest (which excels in data with higher variance/noise), performed the best, followed by Logistic Regression, and finally KNN.
